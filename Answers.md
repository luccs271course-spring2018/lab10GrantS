# Questions and Answers

-1) Discuss the differences among the results.

-BreadthFirst and ClosestFirst were identical.

-DepthFirst jumped straight to Jordan, (which was the last on the list for both BreadthFirst and ClosestFirst),
-and made some sort of a zig zag pattern. That did not make sense since Saudi Arabia is massive and would be
-needed if travelling on foot.

-RandomWalk looked legitimate since Saudia Arabia was "walked on" every other line.

-2) Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.

-Maps need color because there needs to be more distinguishing features among separate countries since there are
-areas of the world that are very condensed. I would not know what to make of a concentrated cluster at first sight.

-Maps also need more than 4 colors since there are countries that share borders with more than 3 countries at a time.
